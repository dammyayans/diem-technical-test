# Design Decisions and Edge Cases and Areas for Improvement

## Why I Used Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS was selected for its utility-first approach, which enables rapid and flexible styling of components. Key benefits include:

- **Speed**: Quick styling changes directly in the markup.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent design system throughout the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in utilities for different screen sizes.
- **Customization**: Extensive customization options while maintaining a clean codebase.

## Why I Used Headless UI

Headless UI offers completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components. Headless UI is completely unstyled by default, which works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

## How I Applied the Design

The use of a black and white color scheme was intentional to create a simple, classic, and elegant look. This choice ensures:

- **Readability and Accessibility**: High contrast enhances readability.
- **Focus on Content**: Draws attention to the content rather than design elements.
- **Versatility**: Works well across various devices without color clashing or accessibility issues.

## Approach to Adapting Wireframe to Mobile

Adapting the wireframe for mobile involved a mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness and user-friendliness on smaller screens.

## Edge Cases and Considerations

**Thumbnails Section**: In the wireframes, it shows multiple thumbnails. To handle this:

- I've added the thumbnails section, but it will show at most four images. If there are more than four images, additional handling will be required, such as adding a scrollable section.

# Areas for Improvement

## Adding TypeScript

Integrating TypeScript into the project would improve type safety and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors. TypeScript provides better tooling and improves legibility.

## Adding Storybook

Integrating Storybook would allow for isolated component development and E2E testing, improving the development workflow and collaboration with designers.

## Better Approach to Optimizing Images

Implementing image optimization techniques.
